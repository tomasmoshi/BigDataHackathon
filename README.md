Project Proposal 



Team & Names: SRCAG Bears

Idea title: The Fentanyl Fight

Idea

Who (Stakeholder): Hospitals and non profits. These are the places that distribute the Narcan to the community.

Problem:
There is a certain supply of Narcan in San Diego County, with a certain demand as well 
There is a current growing problem of fentanyl usage and overdoses, which are almost always fatal, due to our proximity to the border
There is a lack of awareness surrounding the overall effectiveness of Narcan (75% to 100% effective when used correctly,) which could save numerous lives 

So what: 
Reduce the # of deaths in San Diego County among youth, unhoused individuals, and other demographics
Help hospitals, nonprofits, and other agencies optimize limited resources

In our Presentation:
Regression model that can predict the most optimal distribution of Narcan by Zip Code/general location
Regression model that can predict the rise in fentanyl use and death over 5-10 years
Model displayed in map form, where the stakeholder can interact with the map to view exact Qs of Narcan per zip code in San Diego County





Regression model:
 that can predict the rise in fentanyl use and death over 5-10 years.
When people use Narcan, it can show the decrease in deaths and Fentanoyl use
